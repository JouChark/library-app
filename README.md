## About
The original objective of this project was mainly to learn how to use a third-party API. But also to practice TypeScript and Bootstrap.

The secondary objective was to turn it into a simple CRUD application with authentication.

The project uses TypeScript and:
* MongoDB to save the data,
* React, React Hooks, for the DOM manipulation,
* Open Library Search API for the search mechanism,
* Bootstrap and pure CSS for a responsive web page,
* Node.js and Express for the client-database communication.
